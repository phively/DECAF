# DECAF
## Data Extraction and Cleaning Automated Framework - in Python!

DECAF provides an extensible framework for performing common data cleaning tasks with modular functions.

## Planned features

* String parsing libraries covering common data types: phone number, email, address...
* Exact and fuzzy match options
* RegEx compatibility, possibly some kind of assistant
* Easy creation of compound operations using config files

## To investigate

* name_matching - company name fuzzy match; see [DeNederlandscheBank/name_matching](https://github.com/DeNederlandscheBank/name_matching/tree/main)
* cleanco - removes common company name suffixes like inc, ltd, etc.
